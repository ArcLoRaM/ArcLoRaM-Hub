# ArcLoRaM Simulator


ArcLoRaM simulator is part of a larger project available at  https://github.com/Rorschak84/ArcLoRaM-Hub , please consult the linked report for a total explanation of the protocol whereabouts and implementations.

It features a real time event simulator, a simple but robut physical layer virtualization, an event scheduler and many more.
3 modes out of the 6 are implemented in the current state that can be run with two different topologies (simple line and mesh).

## Installation

The simplest way to run the protocol is by using docker. 
(on its way...)

However, if you wish to implement your own logic, improve the protocol, optimize the simulator engine, it is better to use it with an IDE as it enables live debugging.
I personnaly used Visual Studio Code with the latest C++ extention.
The engine is able to connect to the visualiser with local host using the port 5000 through tcp packets.
Consequently, SFML system and network module are required, even though you donÂ´t use the GUI (which uses window and graphics additionally).(The simulator only needs SFML-system and SFML-network to build (Version 3.0.0))

A nice tutorial to link, and add to the compiler SFML on Vscode:

Little advice for Visual Studio Code users: the C++ extension developped by microsoft offers you the possibility to link libraries and build you project using the tasks.json file instead of using command lines as it is described in the youtube video. I recommend following the steps described in the video and once you get familiar with the process, try to run an SFML demo code with build configuration from the tasks.json and later build the entire project with tasks.json.
I've let my vscode folder to help you understand the process but you need to personnalize it to link the library correctly. Futhermore, You should be mindful about which SFML binaries (ddl) you are using as it depends on the OS, C++ compiler and SFML version.

## Run the protocol
Clone the repository, install SFML, build correctly the project and you're ready to run the protocol.
However, you must select the mode, the topology and decide if the simulator will be connected with the visualizer or not.

For that, you simply needs to reach the common.hpp file and change the number of the COMMUNICATION_PERIOD and TOPOLOGY variables.

Don't forget to launch the visualiser before running the simulator if you decide to connect them. In the case, you don't, set the visualiserConnected variable to false. (in common.hpp)


## Improvements

This is one of my largest project ever made, and the occasion to refresh my c++. Even though I emphasized clarity and maintanability, some newbies mistakes are likely to be present.
